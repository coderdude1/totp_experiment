Simple spring MVC project, derived from the intellij tutorial found here:

http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Getting+Started+with+Spring+MVC,+Hibernate+and+JSON

Its slowly evolving to a nice playground for experimenting with jquery, spring security, hibernate, etc.  I've migrated
the db stuff from H2 to postgres, added jquery 1.something, etc.
